Problem: If user inputs a time like 09:00, it’s accepted — but if current time is already past 09:00, the alarm doesn't go off.

Fix Suggestion:
Tell the user “Time has passed” and ask if they want to:

Set for tomorrow, or

Retry with a future time





Currently, the music plays fully unless the user closes the terminal or waits.

Improvement:
Let user press a key (like Enter) to stop the music:

python
Copy code
print("Press Enter to stop the alarm.")
input()
pygame.mixer.music.stop()
This avoids needing to wait for the full song to end.
